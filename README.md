# Solar Wind Speed Prediction WebAPP
Developed a Web Application using StreamLit which could predict the solar wind speed of the Sun using a Deep learning Model from realtime
images and plot the graph between the actual and predicted values.
The WebApp is hosted in StreamLit Cloud and can be accessed at: https://share.streamlit.io/satyaki01/test-repo/main/app.py
